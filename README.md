# Task-6
Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## üß™ Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com) ‚Äì Online password strength checker

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Followed

1. **Created Multiple Passwords**
   - Ranging from weak to strong
   - Included variations in length, symbols, numbers, and randomness

2. **Tested Each Password**
   - Used PasswordMeter to analyze strength
   - Recorded scores and feedback

3. **Researched Password Security**
   - Reviewed common attack methods (e.g., brute-force, dictionary attacks)
   - Learned how complexity and uniqueness defend against these attacks

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

- Use **at least 12‚Äì16 characters**
- Include a **mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- Avoid using **dictionary words or common patterns**
- Never reuse passwords across multiple sites
- Consider using **passphrases** (e.g., `Ocean$Taco!92Laptop`)
- Use a **password manager** to generate and store strong passwords

| Attack Type        | Description                                     | Defense                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force        | Tries every possible combination                | Use long, complex passwords                              |
| Dictionary Attack  | Tries known words and phrases                   | Avoid common words and predictable variations            |
| Credential Stuffing| Uses leaked passwords from other breaches       | Use unique passwords for each account                    |
| Phishing           | Tricks users into revealing passwords           | Use MFA and verify email/site legitimacy                 |

## üìà Key Takeaways

- Password **length** and **randomness** are more important than complexity alone.
- **Password managers** improve security and usability.
- Strong passwords protect against automated attacks and data breaches.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** adds a critical extra layer of defense.
